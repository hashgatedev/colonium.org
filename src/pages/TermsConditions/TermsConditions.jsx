                  Coloniume is an Australian company based in Sydney. With a diverse team of experienced and multinational experts, the company (according to the White paper) intends to provide its service providers with a new coin named “Colonix Coin” in the form of a reward system. The section "Terms and Conditions" (T&C) presents the practical information on the use of the Coloniume Decentralized Alternative Network (CDAN) and its services, operated and managed by Coloniume.

                  <li>Coloniume aims to create a cryptocurrency, the so-called Coloniume platform, for a proven, safe, liquid, and secure currency, which is practical for all people across the world.</li>
                  <li>Based on the blockchain platform, Coloniume cryptocurrency is created as a service payment in this platform, and a rewarding program for the community.</li>
                  <li>Coloniume does not have the legal qualification as a security, since it does not give any rights on dividends or interest, any ownership right or stake share or
                    equivalent rights or any right to receive future profits shares, or any other form of participation in or relating to the Company, nor shall Colonix Coin
                    holders have any influence or rights in the development or governance of the Company. Colonix Coin, therefore, is not a share and does not give any right to
                    participate in the general meetings of the Company. Colonix Coin is final and non-refundable. The acquirement and use of Colonix Coin shall not be done for
                    speculative usage.</li>
                  <li>Colonix Coin can be provided by the proof of the work or through a valid exchange so that you can use upcoming services of the Coloniume.</li>
                  <li>The Company gives no warranties that Coloniume Coins will be exchangeable on specific platforms or that they shall remain exchangeable on exchange platforms or that they would be exchangeable on other exchanges.</li>
                  <li>Colonix Coin is not investment advice or a security nor an investment product, and any action, notice, communication, message, decision, managerial act, or
                    omission associated with it shall not be understood and interpreted as such. The company does not guarantee any of the Colonix Coins value and explicitly warns users
                    that there is no reason to believe that Colonix Coins will increase in value, and they might also decrease in value or lose their value entirely. You represent
                    and warrant, that you are acquiring Colonix Coins for your personal use and your utility and not for investment or financial purposes. You also confirm that
                    you do not consider Coloniume as a security and you know that Colonix Coins may completely lose their value and that you are not purchasing Colonix Coins for
                    investing and that you are aware of all other risks deriving from holding Colonix Coin, as specified in these Terms and you accept them.</li>
                  <li>Coloniume is not a financial institution and is currently not under the supervision of any financial supervisory authority. It does not provide any licensed financial services, such as investment services, fund management, or investment advice. None of the information or analysis presented herein are intended to form the basis for any investment decision, no specific recommendations are intended, and the Coloniume website and Colonix Coins do not offer, are not, and shall not be construed as investment or financial products. In the event of any regulatory changes
                    impacting Coloniume, Coloniume reserves the right to amend its services, the website, and the Colonix Coin.</li>

              <div className="paragraph1" id='coinp'>

                <p>
                  The coin distribution is not a public offering of equity or debt and consequently does not fall under the securities or any prospectus regulation. You can contribute to a smart contract system in Coloniume blockchain, Bittoken (acceptable Digital Assets), or FIAT (according to accepted payment services) and receive Colonix in exchange. The company reserves the right to amend acceptable digital assets or FIAT at any time, based on its sole discretion. All acquirement of Colonix Coins shall be publicly accessible via the Coloniume blockchain browser.

              <h3 className="intro" id='head'>User Wallet Safety</h3>
              <div className="paragraph1" id='headp'>

                <p>
                  Following the purchase or mining of Colonix Coin, the user understands that he/she must keep his/her wallet address and wallet password safe
                  and he/she may not share them with anybody. The User further understands that if his password is lost or stolen, he will not be able to generate a new password
                  or recover the old one, and the cryptocurrencies or Coloniume associated with the user's wallet will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost. Furthermore,
                  he user understands that without the password there is no recovery mechanism for lost passwords, so no one will be able to help the user retrieve or reconstruct
                  lost password and provide the user with access to any lost Coloniume or cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the user understands that it is not possible to reconstruct a lost or stolen wallet.</p>
              </div>


              <h3 className="intro" id='head'>Risks</h3>
              <div className="paragraph1" id='headp'>

                <p>
                  The User understands and accepts that the Coloniume Platform concept, the underlying software application, and the software platform (i.e. the Cryptocurrency blockchain) are still in an early development stage and are unproven, hence there is no warranty that the process for creating Colonix Coin will be uninterrupted or error-free, and there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, including, the complete loss of Colonix Coin.          </p>
                <p>
                  The User understands and accepts that the blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and probably certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations or introduce new regulations on blockchain technology-based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the Coloniume Platform and which may result in substantial modifications of the Coloniume Platform, including its termination and the loss of Colonix Coin for the user.</p>
                <p>The User understands and accepts that the creation of Coloniume and the development of the Coloniume Platform may be abandoned for several reasons. For example, lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, and lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). The User, therefore, understands that there is no assurance that, even if the Coloniume Platform is partially or fully developed and launched, the user will receive any benefits through the Colonix Coin held by the user.</p>
                <p>Colonix Coin can only be accessed by using a cryptocurrency wallet with a combination of the user's account information. The user understands and accepts that if the user's passphrase respectively got lost or stolen, the obtained Coloniume associated with the user's account (address) or password will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost.</p>
                <p>The user understands and accepts that the Coloniume Platform concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the cryptocurrency blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals, likely resulting in theft or loss of cryptocurrencies and/or Colonix Coin, in turn impacting the ability to develop the Coloniume Platform.</p>
                <p>The user understands and accepts that, in line with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Coloniume Platform is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, "selfish-mining" attacks, and race condition attacks. As mentioned earlier, the mining attacks may target the blockchain networks with which Coloniume interacts any successful attacks present a risk to the Colonix coins. Coloniume shall not be liable for the consequences of the mentioned attacks.</p>
                <p>The users understand and accept, that the wallet or wallet service provider used for the contribution, has to be technically compatible with Coloniume. The failure to assure this may deprive the user of access to the user’s Coloniume.</p>
              </div>

              <h3 className="intro" id='head'>Development failure or abortion</h3>
              <div className="paragraph1" id='headp'>

                <p>
                  Acquiring and storing Colonix Coins involves various risks, in particular, the probable inability of Coloniume to launch some operations and continue developing its
                  platform or community. Therefore, before acquiring Colonix Coin all users should carefully consider the risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring Coloniume within the coin sale,
                  and, if necessary, take independent advice in this field from its reliable experts and take personal responsibility for their decisions in accepting the terms.
                  Any interested person who does not understand or accept the risks associated with the activity (incl. the risks related to the non-development
                  of the Coloniume network and operations) or any other risks as indicated in the T&C, should not acquire Colonix Coin, at this stage or later.</p>
              </div>

              <h3 className="intro" id='head'>Legal Risk concerning Security Regulation</h3>
              <div className="paragraph1" id='headp'>

                <p>
                  There is a risk that Colonix Coins might be considered a security threat in some jurisdictions, either now or in the future. The company does not give warranties or
                  guarantees that Colonix Coins are not a security issue in all jurisdictions. Each user of Coloniume shall bear its own legal or financial consequences of Colonix Coins
                  being considered a security threat in their respective jurisdiction. The legal ability of the company to provide Colonix Coins may be eliminated in some jurisdictions by
                  future regulation or legal actions. In the case when it turns out with a high degree of certainty that Colonix Coins are not legal in a certain jurisdiction, the company,
                  based on its sole discretion, will either (a) cease operations in that jurisdiction, or (b) adjust Colonix Coins to make them compliable with the regulation of that jurisdiction.
                  You must check if the acquisition and disposal of Colonix Coins are legal in your jurisdiction,
                  and by accepting these Terms you expressly agree and warrant that you will not use Coloniume if their use is not legal in the relevant jurisdiction.</p>

                <p>
                  Nobody can guarantee that the Coloniume blockchain source code used by the company will be perfect. It may contain certain flaws, errors, defects, and bugs,
                  which may disable some functions for users, show users’ information, etc. Such flaws would endanger the usability and/or security of the company and consequently cause adverse
                  impacts on the value of the  open-source codes of the company and Coloniume is not liable for the consequences of the above-mentioned cases, and the user accepts the irresponsibility clause of the Coloniume.</p>

                  <p>
                    The blockchain source code could be updated, amended, altered, or modified occasionally by the developers and/or the community of Coloniume.
                    Nobody can foresee or guarantee the precise result of such update, amendment, alteration, or modification. As a result, any update, amendment, alteration
                    , or modification could lead to an unexpected or unintended outcome, adversely affecting Colonix Coins and/or the company's operation or market value.
                    Coloniume is not responsible for the consequences of the above-mentioned cases, and the user accepts the non-responsibility clause of the Coloniume.</p>

                  <p>
                    You acknowledge that the risks associated with cryptography, such as code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers,
                    could impose risks to all cryptocurrencies including Colonix Coins. This could result in the theft, loss, disappearance, destruction,
                    or devaluation of Coloniume. Reasonably, the company will be prepared to take proactive or remedial steps to update the company's protocol in response
                    to any advances in cryptography and take additional reasonable security measures where appropriate. It is impossible to predict the future of cryptography or the future of security innovations to an extent that would permit the
                    company accurately guide the development of the company while considering such unforeseeable changes in the domains of cryptography or security.</p>

                <div className="paragraph1" id='headp'>

                  <p>
                    Blockchain is an open-source project supported by the community. Anybody may develop a patch or upgrade the code of a Blockchain source
                    without prior authorization of anyone else. The acceptance of Blockchain patches or upgrades by a significant, but not overwhelming,
                    percentage of the users could result in a “fork” in the blockchain of the Coloniume, and consequently the operation of two separate networks,
                    and will remain separated until the forked blockchains are merged. The temporary or permanent existence of forked blockchains could adversely
                    impact the operation and the market value of the Colonix and in the worst-case scenario, could ruin the sustainability of the company. While
                    such a fork in the blockchain of Coloniume would possibly be resolved by community-led efforts to merge the forked blockchains, the success
                    is not guaranteed and could take a long time to achieve. Coloniume is not liable for the consequences of the above-mentioned cases, and the
                    user accepts this non-responsibility clause of Coloniume.</p>

                  <p>
                    Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. Coloniume could be impacted by one or more
                    regulatory inquiries or actions, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the use or possession of Colonix Coins, probably impeding or limiting
                    their existence, the permissibility of their use and possession, and their value.</p>

                    “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Mining Attacks, as described above, may also target other blockchain networks, with which Coloniume interacts.
