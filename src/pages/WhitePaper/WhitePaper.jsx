            <h3 id="part1">A philosophy named Coloniume</h3>
            <p>Today, universal access to the internet and information technology is widely recognized as a fundamental necessity for any society. This is due to the fact that advanced information and communication technologies enable individuals to access vast sources of information, which is crucial for the development of societies in various dimensions including scientific, economic, political, and cultural.
            </p>
            <p>Our beliefs and confirmed theories indicate that the growth and development of the World Wide Web is directly and inherently related to the development of educational, economic, health, medical services, and other fields of activity in the current era. With the Internet eliminating geographical, national, and ethnic barriers, it plays a fundamental role in the flourishing of industry, trade, and economy of countries. The internet's communication platform has become one of the most important political, social, and economic tools in human history, as it facilitates the convergence and evolution of cultures and brings civilizations closer to each other. Information technology has become pervasive and has significantly transformed the world. The development of computer communication and technology has been accelerated, and the convergence and unification of these dynamic and energetic processes have given rise to the information society.
            </p>
            <p>The world faces significant obstacles in the development and equitable distribution of the internet network, with some countries receiving a fair share of access while others are limited. However, a closer look reveals that even within a country, individuals do not have equal access to the internet, with economic power determining the amount, quality, and quantity of access. This digital divide highlights the inequalities in accessing information and communication technologies, which is a major challenge in realizing the information society. The concept of the digital divide suggests that the use of communication and information technologies is not distributed fairly between countries and within societies. Unequal and limited access to the internet is the primary factor in creating this gap. Consequently, the issue of accessing an efficient, secure, and accessible internet platform has become a serious and new challenge, and access to information and communication technologies is becoming a necessary condition for a nation's abilities. Enjoying a wide range of rights, including access to information and communication technologies, is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part2">What is Coloniume?</h3>
            <p>Based on the above discussion, we can infer the general purpose of Coloniume. Our aim is to create a new concept of a global network that provides people worldwide with access to the free Internet. The Coloniume network will be extensive, exclusive, powerful, and free,
            </p>
            <p>intending to reduce the digital divide and promote science, culture, economy, hygiene, health, and other aspects of human life around the world based on the principles of justice and freedom of access to the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>U + Me = “Coloniume”</p>
            <p>Our ultimate goal is to create a massive, free Coloniume network that brings together people from all over the world, where the equation U + Me = "Coloniume" represents the idea of collaboration and unity, building a cohesive global community that meets the interests and demands of each individual.
            </p>
            <p>Coloniume is a free and decentralized communication network that is independent of governments and is developed and expanded by individuals, organizations, and independent NGOs. The network will primarily be built through the participation of individuals from around the world.
            </p>
            <p>The primary objective of Coloniume is to establish and grow a completely free, secure, and non-governmental communication platform that is impervious to censorship, restrictions, or outside influence. The network will enable uninterrupted communication with all other communication networks.
            </p>
            <p>Coloniume will enhance the accessibility of the internet, even in areas where there is network disconnection, by allowing local exchange of information and data without any geographical or political restrictions. Additionally, each node of the network will have the ability to connect to the internet and act as a bridge between the local network and the internet. This feature is particularly crucial in the Internet of Things (IoT) sector, especially in hospitals and emergency centers where internet disconnections can have severe consequences.
            </p>
            <p>To facilitate the expansion of the network, standard communication hardware will be utilized. Participants who provide services to the network will receive rewards based on the services offered and the total service provided. This incentivization system will help to upgrade and accelerate the network's expansion.
            </p>
            <p>The Coloniume network offers completely free internet access to its users, allowing them to build their own communication networks using standard equipment such as mobile phones. By sharing free Wi-Fi with others, users can not only help maintain a stable internet connection, but also become part of the Coloniume network and receive rewards for their contributions.
            </p>
            <p>The Coloniume network boasts a range of unique capabilities, including:</p>
            <ol type="A">
              <li> The ability to establish an independent free local and global communication network through the deployment of second-generation nodes (LINKER NODES).
              </li><li> Connectivity to the World Wide Web.
              </li><li> An independent blockchain network that provides secure and unlimited services.
              </li><li> The ability to create specific, decentralized, and unrestricted platforms and social networks.
              </li><li> A super safe messenger that allows users to send messages peer-to-peer.
              </li><li> The ability to build a Coloniume PC and connect to a memory and distributed processor, allowing individuals to access distributed storage and processing services at an affordable cost.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Coloniume will introduce a groundbreaking generation of low-cost computers, known as Coloniume PCs or Coloniume computers, which will not require a processor or storage space. Instead, these devices will utilize shared resources on the Coloniume network to meet all computing needs.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, the Coloniume network values environmental sustainability and strives to use all resources in an economical manner. To this end, Coloniume miners will avoid making any redundant processing efforts when solving blocks. Only network traffic that provides useful services will be rewarded in the Coloniume network.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part3">Implementation steps</h3>
            <p>Problem statement:</p>
            <p>The Internet is a critical infrastructure for global development, but it is not the only one. Despite geographic, climatic, and racial differences, the world is integrating and converging through the Internet. This integration helps to reduce various inequalities, but only if access to the Internet is equitable. Information and communication technology has significant effects on economic, social, cultural, and political affairs. Unfortunately, the gap between countries that effectively leverage this technology and those that do not is rapidly widening.
            </p>
            <p>The Coloniume team has identified common global issues that include all people around the world, which need to be solved or minimized to expand Internet access at the public level and reduce the digital divide caused by weak or nonexistent Internet access in deprived parts of the world. These issues include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Global reliance on Internet services during times of quarantine
              </li><li>High costs associated with using the Internet
              </li><li>Lack of proper Internet coverage in many areas
              </li><li>Inadequate Internet quality in some countries or regions
              </li><li>Increasing costs of personal computers
              </li><li>High power consumption and increased energy usage of personal computers
              </li><li>Censorship of information and restricted flow of information globally
              </li><li>Limited public access to Internet services
              </li></ul>
            <p>The Coloniume team aims to address these issues and achieve their ultimate goal of providing a solution to these global problems.
            </p>
            <p>Below is a brief explanation of each of the aforementioned issues and problems to illustrate their significance and impact on the lives of individuals and societies:
            </p>
            <h3 id="part4">Global quarantine and dependence on Internet services</h3>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, a disease that spread worldwide regardless of physical and geographical boundaries, resulted in heavy fatalities, financial losses, and emotional effects. However, the Internet and digital technology came to the aid of humanity during this dangerous time. The Internet played a vital role in the universal exchange of scientific and technical information in the prevention and control of this disease. The significance of the Internet during the quarantine period cannot be overstated, and it can be referred to as the redemptive factor for humans in this era. The medical staff provided comprehensive and complete information about the disease through the Internet to people worldwide, enabling them to train and implement prevention methods. The early recognition of the disease's signs through online training saved millions of lives. The impact of the Internet on other vital parts of the world during the quarantine period is also significant and commendable, particularly in education and learning. With the ability to communicate over long distances, virtual classes from elementary to academic levels were conducted efficiently and effectively.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part5">The High Cost Barrier to Internet Access</h3>
            <p>The significance of the Internet in public education and microeconomics, particularly in small local businesses, is undeniable. However, the high cost of Internet access poses a significant obstacle for many people, including students, housewives, and small business owners. This creates a digital divide that exacerbates existing social and economic disparities, particularly in developing countries where the lack of infrastructure and economic prosperity makes Internet development more expensive. The Coloniume Foundation recognizes this challenge and considers it one of its primary missions to provide free and accessible Internet of the same quality and speed as in advanced countries, even in the most remote and underprivileged areas. The Foundation hopes to achieve this goal to bridge the digital divide and reduce social and economic inequalities.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part6">Inadequate Internet Coverage</h3>
            <p>The varying social, economic, and cultural conditions of different regions, as well as the uneven distribution of resources and budgets between metropolises and suburban areas, lead to disparities in income and subcultures within a country. Some individuals have access to modern amenities and up-to-date information, while others with sufficient qualifications and talents lack the necessary hardware and software due to limited financial and educational resources. Such inequalities inevitably exacerbate and widen the social divide both within countries and among citizens.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part7">Poor Internet Quality in Some Countries or Regions</h3>
            <p>The quantitative development and utilization of the internet as a key indicator of progress towards an information society highlights the stark disparities in access and resources among individuals and countries. These imbalances deepen social inequalities and pose a challenge to the global pursuit of wisdom and wealth, which increasingly depends on access to information and the ability to analyze data. Developing countries often lack the necessary national infrastructure, telecommunications, and economic prosperity to support the expensive development of the internet, resulting in limited access for citizens, particularly those in marginalized communities. This issue is compounded by the monopolization of internet technology by government centers, and language barriers that restrict access to information available only in English. These inequalities contribute to a global imbalance in the use of information society advancements, with the North-South divide being a notable example. Coloniume aims to bridge this gap by creating a secure, free and quality platform for all, regardless of geographic location or socio-economic status. By utilizing its reward system formula, Coloniume can identify and address areas with unfavorable internet access, providing incentives for Miners to relocate from high-speed locations to low-speed locations to earn more rewards. This will help improve internet coverage in deprived areas, reduce the digital divide and promote a more homogeneous global average for internet access through the Coloniume Network.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part8">The rising cost of personal computers and its impact on accessibility and usage</h3>
            <p>The sharp rise in the price of computer components has made it difficult for most people to afford premium pieces, and even inexpensive systems have become unavailable to the general public. This issue has been compounded by the start of the school year, as many schools have turned to online and distance education to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. As a result, families are under pressure to provide computer and laptop equipment for their children to continue their education. Additionally, the increased demand for telecommuting jobs and internet-based businesses has further exacerbated the problem. Unfortunately, there is no clear solution in sight for these challenges in the short term. The Coloniume team aims to address these issues on a global scale.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part9">High Power Consumption and Energy Consumption by Personal Computers</h3>
            <p>In today's world, where technology is an integral part of offices and organizations, the energy consumption of various devices is on the rise. Computers and their accessories such as monitors, scanners, and printers are among the most significant factors contributing to the increase in electricity consumption in offices, even surpassing the consumption of lighting. According to a study, computer systems and accessories consume about 8% of total household electricity, and an additional 25% is consumed by other electronic devices.
            </p>
            <p>Notably, computers consume almost six times more energy than laptops, which are optimized for battery life.
            </p>
            <p>To conserve energy reserves and reduce environmental pollution, many countries have implemented energy management programs that prioritize rational and optimal energy use, reduce energy demand, and improve technology and equipment efficiency while providing necessary facilities. These programs aim to achieve quantitative goals while preventing environmental pollution.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part10">Free Flow of Information on a Global Scale</h3>
            <p>The freedom of information is the cornerstone of democracy. Without it, society cannot truly claim to be democratic. In recent years, the right to access information and the free flow of information has received significant attention. This is due to the growing and amazing development of mass media worldwide, providing access to news and reports from the farthest regions of the world. The use of media, super media, and new internet-based communication technologies has created a "global village" or "glass world," where people are acutely aware of each other.
            </p>
            <p>Thanks to the power of the internet, the voice of the oppressed from even the remotest villages can be heard worldwide, preventing silent and hidden injustices. Access to information also accelerates innovation and initiative in society, identifies talents, and supports their growth and development.
            </p>
            <p>The Coloniume Foundation recognizes the power of the internet to promote justice and equality worldwide. Through its efforts, it seeks to ensure free access to the free flow of information over the internet, making the world a better place by reducing injustice and increasing access to information.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part11">The Challenge of Limited Access to Internet Services for the Public</h3>
            <p>Governments and international organizations recognize the importance of developing Internet access in developing countries, and communications and development experts share this view. They believe that the Internet and related telecommunications technologies should be considered as national, strategic infrastructure to improve economic productivity, governance, education, health, and quality of life, particularly in marginalized areas. Establishing such a strategic infrastructure is critical for developing countries to improve their political-economic conditions.
            </p>
            <p>Lack of public access to Internet services can lead to the underdevelopment of countries at the international level, and it is unfortunate that billions of people still lack sufficient access to the Internet. On the other hand, those who have access to the Internet can work from home, access information and learning tools, improve their businesses, communicate with their loved ones from afar, and better protect themselves during emergencies.
            </p>
            <p>Investing in providing people with access to the Internet benefits both the people and their respective countries. Coloniume recognizes this issue and has made the amount of Internet development participation a factor in its reward system. This tangible connection between the reward and the region's number of people who access the Internet through this publication and development will significantly reduce problems with public access to Internet services. The aim is to enable anyone to have access to safe, cheap, or free Internet services.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part12">Benefits of Implementing the Coloniume Network</h3>
            <p>Investing in providing people with access to the Internet has mutual benefits for both individuals and their countries. By recognizing this issue, Coloniume has made the amount of Internet development participation a factor in its reward system. This creates a tangible connection between the reward, the region, and the number of people who access the Internet through this publication and development. This factor increases the amount of Coloniume rewards by providing better internet services to more people. As a result, public access to safe, cheap, or free internet services will significantly reduce problems related to the lack of access to the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>After discussing the Coloniume team's main goal of addressing internet-related issues, the benefits of launching a Coloniume network can be summarized as follows. The Coloniume Foundation aims to achieve higher humanitarian and benevolent objectives, and the following are some of the primary goals of Coloniume:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Promoting the free flow of information
              </li><li>Ensuring free internet access for everyone
              </li><li>Improving the quality of life
              </li><li>Expanding internet businesses
              </li><li>Boosting the prosperity of the internet economy
              </li><li>Providing free public education
              </li><li>Encouraging industrial prosperity
              </li><li>Launching a local network for communication in emergencies and crises
              </li><li>Reducing energy consumption by entering personal computers into the market
              </li><li>Providing public access to much cheaper computers than personal computers, which are highly secure.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="part13">Free flow of information</h3>
            <p>The Internet has revolutionized the free flow of information, breaking down national barriers and advancing mobile technology. However, this progress has not been uniform across the globe, and challenges remain in areas such as ethnicity, religion, gender, and origin.
            </p>
            <p>At the national level, government policies and attitudes directly impact the flow of data. The nature of information is based on its dissemination and flow within societies. Obstacles and restrictions to freedom of expression have always existed, and they also hinder the realization of freedom of information. These restrictions are often imposed by non-democratic political systems and create a barrier to national development and prosperity.
            </p>
            <p>To overcome these barriers, Coloniume seeks to expand the reach of safe, accessible, and public internet and provide free international transfer of information. By doing so, Coloniume aims to bridge the gaps and eliminate obstacles that hinder the free flow of information, enabling the realization of democratic values and supporting national development.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part14">Free internet access for everyone</h3>
            <p>For many years, the dream of expanding the Internet internationally has been at the forefront of human aspirations. The Internet has played a crucial role in advancing social, economic, medical, public health, educational, and welfare issues. While efforts have been made to improve the Internet internationally, the majority of these efforts have been driven by utilitarian and profit-driven motives. Coloniume, however, is a constitution that seeks to expand and develop a safe, public, and free Internet that meets the needs of every human being, regardless of ethnicity, race, or geography. This is one of Coloniume's most fundamental goals, which will be pursued with dedicated effort.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part15">Improving the Quality of Life</h3>
            <p>The world is rapidly transforming into an information society where access to knowledge and the ability to use it effectively is crucial. However, this transition is not without costs, as some societies struggle with the expenses associated with adopting information and communication technologies. Despite this, globalization and technological advancements have made the impact of information on human societies an issue that affects all countries in some way.
            </p>
            <p>The shift from a focus on productive technology to information technology has ushered in a new era of social life, commonly known as the "information society". In this society, knowledge is highly valued and seen as an investment that serves humanity, rather than the other way around. The growth of individual capabilities and epistemological-human development are the driving forces behind this type of society, allowing citizens to move from the paradigm of life for survival to the paradigm of life for growth.
            </p>
            <p>Coloniume recognizes the importance of striving for growth and excellence and has made social and economic justice a primary goal in its efforts to create a developed world. By prioritizing this goal, Coloniume aims to create a world where citizens have equal access to knowledge and opportunities for personal and collective growth.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part16">Expanding online businesses</h3>
            <p>In today's digital world, digital business has become the most effective way to generate macro profits and achieve success. The global digital revolution brought about by internet technology has transformed the way we work, live, play, and learn. The universality and influence of the internet have made it possible to work faster and more efficiently. The digital revolution has the potential to disrupt markets faster than any other force in history, and organizations that do not embrace digital career developments are likely to fall behind. Those that have embraced digitalization are experiencing new revenue streams and unprecedented business growth.
            </p>
            <p>It is clear that organizations need to be courageous and embrace digitalization to stay competitive and achieve their goals. Almost all markets and industrial sectors are shifting from the information age to the digital age. Countries, cities, and companies have realized that they must evolve to survive and prosper in this new era. This shift requires far-reaching changes in technology, organizational management, culture, and more.
            </p>
            <p>The process of digitalization and upgrading critical infrastructure, increasing GDP, reducing costs, and creating jobs will enable new and diverse groups of resourceful entrepreneurs to create new jobs worldwide. This will provide more access and opportunities for technology-based professions, narrowing the gap between the development of countries and increasing the level of competition among them. Therefore, a proper digital ecosystem is essential to achieve these goals. Coloniume aims to provide this ecosystem to people worldwide, with the help of individuals who care about their destiny and that of their fellow human beings. The Blue Angels of Coloniume, who will be defined in the future, are the saviors of the spread of the free, universal, and secure internet.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part17">Internet Expansion</h3>
            <p>In today's communication era, the internet has the power to eliminate physical and geographical barriers, allowing individuals from diverse backgrounds to interact freely and without limitation. The impact of this on individuals' self-actualization is profound. These interactions, thoughts, and visualizations are digitized and can be shared with the global internet community, where they can be integrated and expanded upon by like-minded individuals. The metaphor of the shared brain highlights the potential for transforming self-awareness and self-knowledge into unique global innovations, as people collaborate and achieve more together than they could alone.
            </p>
            <p>Internet technology also allows for self-reflective communication, enabling individuals to build their identity based on their perceptions of themselves. By relying on the power of internet connection, modern humans can overcome temporal and spatial limitations to show their true selves to the world. This principle drives Coloniume's mission to bring the internet to the poorest and most remote parts of the world, giving those who have been deprived and living in poverty the opportunity to show their creations to the world.
            </p>
            <p>From a postmodern and relativistic perspective, data reveals elements such as passion, accuracy, temperament, ideology, and spirituality, contributing to a whole that represents the essence of human existence. This whole is a masterpiece that makes the world exist, and the internet plays a crucial role in bringing it to light. Coloniume believes that by connecting the world through the internet, humanity can tap into its full potential and achieve great things together.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part18">Free public education</h3>
            <p>With the increasing virtualization of life, many governments have turned to online classes and discussions as the best option for managing the affairs of the country and people's lives. This institutionalization of the virtual lifestyle is being pursued in all fields, as evidenced by the experience of online and internet-based classes during the Covid-19 epidemic. Compared to other educational fields, the resources and infrastructure necessary to provide life and education in virtual space are usually maximally provided to students, thus achieving a degree of justice in resources. In fact, combining the internet and education is crucial for establishing equality in society, as e-learning has the potential to be the greatest factor in achieving this in the present century. By removing barriers related to time, place, and socioeconomic status, individuals can take responsibility for their lifelong learning.
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, the educational discourse on the internet is dynamic and interactive, unlike traditional methods. The quantity and quality of education on the internet are also different and better than the traditional education system. The internet provides a wide range of information and education for countless people easily and quickly, allowing everyone to use the best professors and educational resources in any place and at any time. The internet also enables individuals to manage their own information and learning, with the ability to store or revisit information whenever they want. This flexibility allows for a limitless information search and learning, revolutionizing the traditional educational system.
            </p>
            <p>It is clear that the internet has the potential to create a more equitable society, by providing a platform for accessible and quality education. This is the path that Coloniume seeks to create and revitalize for people around the world, of all ages, classes, and races who are keen to learn and educate themselves.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part19">Industrial prosperity</h3>
            <p>The dawn of the 21st century ushered in a new era with the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution - the digitalization of the industry. This transformative phase, fueled by the unprecedented advancements in information and communication technology, is set to reshape the future of the industry.
            </p>
            <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterized by the integration and amalgamation of various cutting-edge technologies. Its successful implementation requires not only extensive technological cooperation between companies and countries, but also fundamental organizational and industrial changes. Given that the pace of change in this domain is incredibly fast, it is challenging to keep up with the technological transfer process when learning and collaboration opportunities are limited.
            </p>
            <p>Just as the late development of transportation and heavy industry hindered countries' industrialization in the past, the lack of infrastructure development for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, such as a comprehensive and powerful Internet, flexible manufacturing, artificial intelligence, and skilled workforce, will cause lag in the progression of this revolution. Success in any industry, be it oil and steel, insurance, tourism, or art and cinema, will require quick adaptation to change, a technological ecosystem, digitalization, industrial automation, attention to the Internet of Things, advanced and predictive analysis, and virtual and augmented reality.
            </p>
            <p>Coloniume is committed to safeguarding and sustaining the life and foundations of the world's industry with a round-the-clock and continuous effort, supported by the world's people. The Internet will be secure, robust, and uninterrupted, serving as the infrastructure and vital pulse of the world's industry in all its forms and dimensions.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part20">Establishing a Local Network for Emergency Communication and Crisis Management</h3>

              </li><li>Coloniume Blockchain also allows any Coloniume-compatible equipment to act as a server node and offer communication services, internet sharing, and internal network resources, while enabling service providers to receive rewards.
              </li></ul>
            <h3 id="part21">To get rewards</h3>
            <p>The "Blue Angels" (miners) who provide identified services on the C.D.A.N network will receive rewards and fees in the form of digital currency. Each node that is connected to the network and is providing services such as internet sharing, processing power or storage space is eligible for rewards. These rewards are in the form of the specific C.D.A.N network's digital currency.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part22">The Coloniume network components</h3>
            <p>The Coloniume network comprises several types of devices, including Linker Nodes, CPU Servers, and Data Storage Servers. The Linker Node is a standard and compatible communication device that allows users to connect and share the Internet within the network. The CPU Server and Data Storage server provide storage space and processing power for the network.
            </p>
            <p>Linker Nodes can send and receive data through WIFI and can connect to the Internet through various means, including the Starlink satellite. Further details and information will be provided in future White Paper updates.
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, the device has the ability to detect other similar linker nodes nearby, forming a large network and enabling secure and encrypted data transmission.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part23">Earning money by providing services</h3>
            <p>To connect to the Coloniume network and become a linker node, users can use Coloniume-compatible modems to log into their accounts and start sharing the Internet through Wi-Fi technology. Initially, linker nodes will only share the Internet, but they will be able to provide additional services, such as sharing storage memory and CPU processing power. Users can reserve storage capacity or processing power and dedicate it exclusively to the Coloniume network, after setting the sharing rate.
            </p>
            <p>To incentivize users to provide services, accurate calculation methods will be used to determine the amount of Colonix rewards awarded for each service provided.
            </p>
            <h3 id="part24">The Universal Challenge of Providing Free Internet Access in Deprived Areas</h3>
            <h4>Hot Point:</h4>
            <p>The Hot Point Zone is an important function of the Coloniume Network that allows for the identification and location of less developed areas on a map. This feature enables residents from different parts of the world to increase the reward ratio of the network in these areas and garner the attention of Blue Angels or Coloniume Network developers. Investors who migrate to these areas can assist in expanding the internet and receive greater rewards. To mark an area as a Hot Point, simply log in to the Coloniume website, locate the less developed area on the map, and mark it accordingly.
            </p>
            <h4>Network Consensus Algorithm:</h4>
            <p>The Coloniume Network operates on a consensus algorithm that uses three coefficients to determine rewards. To ensure optimal network performance, changes to these coefficients will be gradually implemented with prior notice.
            </p>
            <ol type="A">
              <li> Quality factor
                <p>The first coefficient is the Quality Factor, which is inversely proportional to jitter and ping. In simpler terms, areas with better internet quality will have a lower coefficient, while areas with more jitter and ping will have a higher coefficient. This incentivizes miners to work towards improving the quality of the internet speed and traffic, leading to an overall improvement in the network's quality over time. As a result, miners can earn higher rewards from the Coloniume network.
                </p>
                <figure>
                  <img src="/img/images/white-paper/quality-factor.jpg" title="" alt="" />
                </figure>
              </li>
              <li> Hotpoint factor
                <p>The Hotpoint factor is determined based on the number of tags assigned to a specific location on the Coloniume website, ranging from 1 to 1.5. Areas that are frequently tagged will have a higher coefficient of 1.5, while areas with no tags will have a coefficient of 1. Other locations will have a coefficient between 1 and 1.5 depending on the number of tags they receive. This incentivizes users to identify and promote less developed areas, thereby encouraging investment and development in those regions.
                </p>
                <figure>
                  <img src="/img/images/white-paper/hotpoint-factor.jpg" title="" alt="" />
                </figure>
              </li><li> Participation factor
                <p>The Participation factor is a crucial component of Coloniume's goal to develop public, high-speed, and free Internet. The numerical value of this coefficient is directly linked to the extent of Internet distribution and sharing, the quality of Internet service, and the number of people who are covered by the Internet. Increasing the participation rate requires individuals to provide high-quality Internet access to more people. The quality of the Internet is calculated based on the average provided. For example, if an individual provides one and a half times the average amount of Internet and Internet time to a person, that person will be counted as 1.5 people. Through this process, Coloniume aims to continuously improve the quality and expand the scope of Internet access on a global scale.
                </p>
                <figure>
                  <img src="/img/images/white-paper/participation-factor.jpg" title="" alt="" />
                </figure>
                <p>To calculate the reward for each person, the three factors mentioned above are combined by multiplying their values together. This produces a score for the individual.
                </p>
                <p>The reward system of Coloniume then uses a formula that takes into account the total points and the amount of Coloniume released in the specified period to determine the amount of Coloniume assigned to each point. This assigned value is then multiplied by the individual's score to determine their specific reward.
                </p>
                <p>Once the reward has been calculated, it is sent to the individual.
                </p>
                <figure>
                  <img src="/img/images/white-paper/reward-factor.jpg" title="" alt="" />
                </figure>
                <p>Colonix coins will be awarded to Blue Angels based on their contribution to the free internet sharing, as well as their contribution to CPU processing power and storage memory sharing.
                </p>
                <p>To maintain the value of the currency and prevent inflation, the number of released coins will be halved every four years. This process will continue until the number of coins reaches zero, which is expected to take several hundred years.
                </p>
                <p>During the first five years, the Coloniume network will release 500 Colonix coins per minute, which will be allocated to all nodes based on their service. This amount will remain fixed per minute.
                </p>
              </li></ol>
            <h3 id="part25">Who are Blue Angels?</h3>
            <figure>
              <img src="/img/images/white-paper/angels.png" title="" alt="" />
            </figure>
            <p>We hold the belief that angels are divine, otherworldly beings, and this is precisely why the name "blue angels" has been chosen for our project. Blue, representing purity, peace, communication, justice, leadership, risk-taking, problem-solving, and inspiration, symbolizes the essence of our vision. Angels, by nature, are transcendent and bring joy, evolving through helping others evolve. Being infinite, non-physical beings, they can assist anyone who seeks their aid and support the less fortunate.
            </p>
            <p>In the context of Coloniume, blue angels are humans who possess a sense of duty, kindness, and helpfulness towards others, fostering awareness, justice, and knowledge in the world. They act as soldiers and commanders, carrying the flag of continuous internet connection. With the Coloniume platform, people from all walks of life - the poorest child in the world, the lost person in the depths of the forest, the student, and the scientist who cannot afford the high cost of internet access - can access the internet for free. Blue angels are the heroes of the present world, and Coloniume highly respects their will, thoughts, and deeds. The rewards they receive from the Coloniume Foundation demonstrate the degree of respect and gratitude that we hold for these noble and honorable individuals who serve as beacons of progress and excellence.
