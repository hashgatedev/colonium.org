              <p className="header1">What is Coloniume?</p>
              <p>Coloniume is a groundbreaking global network project aimed at providing free internet access to people around the world. Its mission is to create
                a new concept of a global network that meets the needs of individuals, regardless of their location or economic status, and to bring the benefits of the internet to everyone.</p>

              <p className="header1">How did Coloniume emerge?</p>
              <p>Coloniume emerged from the vision of a group of experts in cryptocurrencies, computers, and blockchain networks who founded a company in Australia to develop the concept.
                Since its inception, several professional teams across the world have joined forces to work on this massive project.</p>

              <p className="header1">What are the goals of Coloniume?</p>
              <p>Our goal is to create a free, secure and independent network. By joining together, "U" and "Me" create "Coloniume," a global colony that meets our interests and needs. Coloniume will be developed and expanded by individuals and organizations, providing a completely free and secure communication platform. With Coloniume, users will be able to exchange information and data locally,
                even in areas with network disconnection or political restrictions. Each node will act as a bridge between the local network and the Internet, helping to promote global connectivity.</p>

              <p className="header1">Is it possible for all countries to use this network without political restrictions?</p>
              <p>Coloniume network will be available in any country where its nodes are launched by the target country.
                Launching the Coloniume network is beneficial and there is no reason to restrict it.</p>

              <p className="header1">How do miners work? Do they consume electricity? </p>
              <p>Coloniume network miners, also known as Blue Angels, can earn Colonix coins by sharing their internet volume with others.
                This innovative approach eliminates the need for high power consumption and wasteful processing.</p>

              <p className="header1">What is the difference between Coloniume, Colonix and CLNX?</p>
              <p>Coloniume is the dedicated network for this project, and it facilitates the mining of the digital currency known as Colonix. The abbreviation for Colonix is CLNX.</p>

              <p className="header1">What is a Linker Node?</p>
              <p>Linker Nodes are a new generation of Coloniume network communication devices that share Internet traffic at extremely high speed. In addition, they can provide clients with more services,
                detect the similar nearby devices and automatically connect to them, and constitute a free local Coloniume smart network.</p>

              <p className="header1">What does happen if the Internet disconnected in the area covered by Coloniume network?</p>
              <p>Following the development of Coloniume in various regions across the globe and the launch of Linker Nodes, in the event of a local or regional internet disconnection,
                the Coloniume network will utilize local and internal channels, allowing individuals to resume exchange of information within the Coloniume network.</p>

              <p className="header1">Is Coloniume available in my country?</p>
              <p>Yes - the Coloniume network access depends on the number of Blue Angels in your area. The more miners, the easier access to the Coloniume network and free internet access.</p>

              <p className="header1">How can I start sharing and earn Colonix?</p>
              <p>To start mining and earn Colonix, you will first need to set up a Linker Node and register an account on our website. By sharing your internet connection with others through the Linker Node, </p>
